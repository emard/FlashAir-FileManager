## Configuration

 1. Backup the content of SD_WLAN of your SD Card - just in case
 2. Add/Replace the content of SD_WLAN by the one from this repository 
 3. Edit the CONFIG based on your network - I have prepared CONFIG-SAMPLE, it joins existing network - just need to complete SSID/Password and Name    
    * `APPMODE=5` Autostart WLAN mode and configure it to join an existing Network (STA mode)
	* `APPSID` defines the WLAN SSID to join and `APPNETWORKKEY` is the password
	* `DELCGI=/thumbnail.cgi,/config.cgi` disables the cgi scripts to view thumbnails or to configure the settings via browser
	* `WEBDAV=0` disabled the WebDAV drive like features
	* `UPLOAD=1` enables upload via browser
	* For more information please check: https://flashair-developers.com/en/documents/api/config/
